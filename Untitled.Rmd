## Introduction and Motivation
The five leading causes of death in the United States from 1999 to 2014 are cancer, heart disease, unintentional injury, chronic lower respiratory disease, and stroke. The dataset includes the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services public health regions. Therefore, we can investigate the leading causes of death of each region, and suggest accordingly public health policy and remedies.  
 
## Data Descriptions
In this report, we are going to focus on percent excess deaths for locality, and how the five leading causes is distributed to the percent excess death. `Percent excess deaths` for each State are calculated as following: 

percent excess deaths = $\frac{\text{observed death} - \text{expected death}} {\text{observed death}}$
