```{include = F}
Webpage and screencast

You will create a webpage summarizing your project. This should not be as detailed as your submitted R Markdown and HTML files, but should give a overview of the project scope, data, approaches, visualizations, and other results. You should include a link to the GitHub repository containing your R Markdown document.

You will also create a two-minute narrated screencast illustrating your project (screencasts are videos of your computer screen with spoken audio explaining what is shown on the screen â€“ see the RStudio webinar page for some examples). You may use slides, demonstrations, or any other content that is relevant to your project. Publish your screencast on youtube, vimeo, or another online platform, and embed the screencast in your website. The two-minute limit will be strictly enforced.

For both the website and the screencast, your audience is classmates who worked on other projects. It will be helpful to put yourself in their shoes, and ask what information you think will be most interesting. We suggest you emphasize motivation, questions, and results over methods; after all, interested folks can view your complete project on GitHub.

## Introduction and Motivation
The five leading causes of death in the United States from 1999 to 2014 are cancer, heart disease, unintentional injury, chronic lower respiratory disease, and stroke. The dataset includes the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services public health regions. Therefore, we can investigate the leading causes of death of each region, and suggest accordingly public health policy and remedies.  

## Data Descriptions
In this report, we are going to focus on percent excess deaths for locality, and how the five leading causes is distributed to the percent excess death. `Percent excess deaths` for each State are calculated as following: 

percent excess deaths = $\frac{\text{observed death} - \text{expected death}} {\text{observed death}}$
 
* Version of data used for analysis is [Here](https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vdpk-qzpr/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD).\

## Approaches
* From the dataset, we obtain the information that the number of potentially excess deaths from the five leading causes in rural areas was higher than those in urban areas. 

* We then analyzed several factors that might influence the rural-urban difference in potentially excess deaths from the five leading causes, many of which are associated with sociodemographic and ecological differences between rural and urban areas. 

* Through statistical analysis, our report provides an interactive and straightforward view on the potentially excess deaths from the five leading causes of death in non-metropolitan and metropolitan areas. 

* The ultimate goal is to bring attention to preventing deaths in the rural areas through improving healthcare services and public health programs.

## Conclusion
* Nonmetropolitan has significantly higher mean percent excess death than metropolitan areas in all ten years from 2005 to 2015. 
* Nonmetropolitan has significantly higher mean percent excess death than metropolitan areas in all five causes of disease. 
* Southeast region appears to have significantly high mean percent of excess death rate than the others for both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas, but the rural-urban gap is not apparent.
* The mean percent excess death from the five leading causes in rural areas this higher than that in urban areas in all 10 public health regions, although in each public health region, the distribution of mortality of each five causes of disease varies.
* We propose to prevent potential excess deaths by improving health care delivery system, introducing funded rural programs to cultivate health awareness and mediating health care workforce shortages.
