title: Rural-Urban Disparities in Five Leading Causes of Mortality in the United States
---

<br>

## Introduction and Motivation
The five leading causes of death in the United States from 1999 to 2014 are cancer, heart disease, unintentional injury, chronic lower respiratory disease, and stroke. The dataset includes the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services public health regions. Therefore, we can investigate the leading causes of death of each region, and suggest accordingly public health policy and remedies.

## Data Descriptions
In this report, we are going to focus on percent excess deaths for locality, and how the five leading causes is distributed to the percent excess death. `Percent excess deaths` for each State are calculated as following: 

percent excess deaths = $\frac{\text{observed death} - \text{expected death}} {\text{observed death}}$
 
* Version of data used for analysis is [Here](https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vdpk-qzpr/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD).\

## Approaches
* From the dataset, we obtain the information that the number of potentially excess deaths from the five leading causes in rural areas was higher than those in urban areas. 

* We then analyzed several factors that might influence the rural-urban difference in potentially excess deaths from the five leading causes, many of which are associated with sociodemographic and ecological differences between rural and urban areas. 

* Through statistical analysis, our report provides an interactive and straightforward view on the potentially excess deaths from the five leading causes of death in non-metropolitan and metropolitan areas. 

* The ultimate goal is to bring attention to preventing deaths in the rural areas through improving healthcare services and public health programs.

## Conclusion
* Nonmetropolitan has significantly higher mean percent excess death than metropolitan areas in all ten years from 2005 to 2015. 
* Nonmetropolitan has significantly higher mean percent excess death than metropolitan areas in all five causes of disease. 
* Southeast region appears to have significantly high mean percent of excess death rate than the others for both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas, but the rural-urban gap is not apparent.
* The mean percent excess death from the five leading causes in rural areas this higher than that in urban areas in all 10 public health regions, although in each public health region, the distribution of mortality of each five causes of disease varies.
* We propose to prevent potential excess deaths by improving health care delivery system, introducing funded rural programs to cultivate health awareness and mediating health care workforce shortages.
