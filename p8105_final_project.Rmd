## Introduction and Motivation
The five leading causes of death in the United States from 1999 to 2014 are cancer, heart disease, unintentional injury, chronic lower respiratory disease, and stroke. The dataset includes the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services public health regions. Therefore, we can investigate the leading causes of death of each region, and develop accordingly public health policy and remedies. 



## Data Descriptions

* Version of data used for analysis is [Here](https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vdpk-qzpr/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD).\




## Approaches
* From the dataset, we obtain the information that the number of potentially excess deaths from the five leading causes in rural areas was higher than those in urban areas. 

* We then analyzed several factors that might influence the rural-urban difference in potentially excess deaths from the five leading causes, many of which are associated with sociodemographic and ecological differences between rural and urban areas. 

* Through statistical analysis, our report provides an interactive and straightforward view on the potentially excess deaths from the five leading causes of death in non-metropolitan and metropolitan areas. 

* The ultimate goal is to bring attention to preventing deaths in the rural areas through improving healthcare services and public health programs.




## Analysis and Visualizations
### Loading Data 
```{r load data,  message=FALSE}
cod_data = read_csv("./data/NCHS_-_Potentially_Excess_Deaths_from_the_Five_Leading_Causes_of_Death.csv") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  filter(!(state == "United States")) %>%
  separate(., percent_potentially_excess_deaths, into = c("percent_excess_death"), sep = "%") %>% 
  mutate(percent_excess_death = as.numeric(percent_excess_death), mortality = observed_deaths/population * 10000, mortality = as.numeric(mortality)) %>% 
  select(year, age_range, cause_of_death, state, locality, observed_deaths, population, expected_deaths, potentially_excess_deaths, percent_excess_death, mortality, hhs_region)

##columns removed

 #"state_fips_code"                      "benchmark"   "potentially_excess_deaths" "percent_excess_death"      "mortality"   

```

* the `year` variable contains data collected from 2005-2015.
* filtered out `United States` in the `state` variable.
* Added a variable `mortality` which is calculated by observed_deaths/population * 10000. This variable indicates the number of deathes observed in every 10000 people in the three geographic regions: `Metropolitan`, `Nonmetropolitan` and `All`.  

```{r region data,  message=FALSE}
region_cod_data = cod_data %>%
  select(state, locality, hhs_region, percent_excess_death) %>% 
  group_by(state,locality, hhs_region) %>% 
  summarise(mean_ped = mean(percent_excess_death)) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(!(state == "District of\nColumbia")) %>% 
  mutate(hhs_region = as.character(hhs_region))


region_lm = lm(region_cod_data$mean_ped~region_cod_data$hhs_region)
rl1 = broom::tidy(region_lm)
kable(rl1)

region_locality_lm =lm(region_cod_data$mean_ped ~ region_cod_data$hhs_region+region_cod_data$locality)
rl2 = broom::tidy(region_locality_lm)
kable(rl2)
```

Interpretation: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services public health regions (1 through 10) are used as a categorical variable in the above regressions. Specific region classification is shown in the figure below.

<img src="./image/hhs_regions.png" style="width:75%">\

As shown in the above summary tables, with respect to region 1, only region 2 have negative estimated coefficient, indicating less mean percentage of excess death . Specifically, comparing with region 1, region 2 have 1.67% less mean percentage of excess death on average. From region 3 to region 10, the mean percentage of excess death is higher comparing with region 1. Similiar results yield from regression adjusted for Locality. Adjusting locality, region 4 and 6 have top two highest increase in mean percetage of excess death with respect to region 1. Adjusting for different regions, similar result yield that, on average, metropolitan have 2% less than overall mean percetage of excess deaths and nonmetropolitan have 7% more than overall mean percetage of excess death.



### Locality vs. Mortality
#### An Overview of the Data
```{r xs2329,  message=FALSE}
cod_data %>%
  mutate(year = as.factor(year))
p <- cod_data %>%
  plot_ly(
    x = ~expected_deaths, 
    y = ~observed_deaths, 
    size = ~population, 
    color = ~cause_of_death, 
    frame = ~hhs_region, 
    text = ~state, 
    hoverinfo = "text",
    type = 'scatter',
    mode = 'markers'
  ) %>% 
  layout(title = "Change of Standardized Mortality Ratio in National Public Health Regions")

p
```



#### Descriptive Analysis

```{r xs2329 boxplot,  message=FALSE}
cod_data %>%
  mutate(cause_of_death = fct_reorder(cause_of_death, mortality)) %>% 
  group_by(cause_of_death) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = cause_of_death, y = mortality, color = cause_of_death)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title="Locality vs. Mortality") +
  labs(x="Locality", y="Mortality", color = "Cause of Death") +
  facet_grid(~locality)

```

This bar graph shows the distribution of cause of death within mortality in the three geographic regions: `Metropolitan`, `Nonmetropolitan` and `All`. We observe that the rank in causes of death is the same regardless of the locality. Nonmetropolitan area seems to have the highest mortaility, the number of deathes observed in every 10000 people. We observe that the median of mortaility of Cancer is the highest among all 5 causes of death, followed by heart disease, unintentional injury, heart disease, chronic lowee respiratory disease and stroke. All 5 causes of death are right skewed regardless of the locality. 



#### Linear Model
To further support our graphs above, linear regression is performed between Mortality and Locality.
Here we obtain the linear regression model of mortality = 4.103 - 0.226localityMetropolitan -1.145localityNonmetropolitan. 
We expect to see 0.22576 less deaths for every 10000 people in the metropolitan region as compared to all regions. 
We expect to see 1.14451 more death for every 10000 people in the nonmetropolitan region as compared to all regions.

```{r xs2329 lm,  message=FALSE}
mortality_lm = lm(mortality ~locality, data = cod_data)
summary(mortality_lm)
rl3 = broom::tidy(mortality_lm)
kable(rl3)
```


##### Map

Here we have generated a map of the United States bases with color gradient showing the mean percent of excess death rate regardless of the locality. [Here](https://fionalav.shinyapps.io/Final_prject_shiny/) is a Shiny link for a closer look of the national distribution of mean percent excess death varied by locality -- metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. We observe for both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas, the Southeast region appears to have significantly high mean percent of excess death rate than the others, but the rural-urban gap is not apparent. This can be explained by the geographic features of the Southeast region. 


```{r,  message=FALSE}
map_cod_data = cod_data %>%
  filter(locality == "Metropolitan") %>%
  select(state, locality, percent_excess_death) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(mean_ped = mean(percent_excess_death)) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(!(state == "District of\nColumbia"))
  

map = as.tibble(fifty_states) %>%
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarize(clong = mean(long), clat = mean(lat)) %>% 
  filter(!(id == "district of columbia"))

df <- cbind(map, state.abb, state.center, rate = unique(map_cod_data$mean_ped))

ggplot(df, aes(map_id = id)) + 
    geom_map(aes(fill = rate), map = fifty_states) + 
    expand_limits(x = fifty_states$long, y = fifty_states$lat) + 
    labs(x = "", y = "") +
    theme(panel.background = element_blank(), 
          axis.text.x = element_blank(), 
          axis.text.y = element_blank(), 
          axis.ticks = element_blank()) + 
    geom_text(aes(x = clong, y = clat, label = state.abb)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low="gold", high="red")


```


If we compare this map with the poverty map of the US, we see that states with higher mean percent excess death is more likely to be in the poverty area.

### Mean Percent Excess Death vs. Locality
#### Data Visualization
**Does mean percent excess death have significant difference between metro and non-metro groups?**
```{r wp2241,  message=FALSE}
gp_cod_data = cod_data %>%
  group_by(year, locality) %>% 
  summarise(mean_ped = mean(percent_excess_death)) 

renderPlotly({
gp_cod_data_Metro = gp_cod_data %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  filter(locality == "Metropolitan")
gp_cod_data_nonMetro = gp_cod_data %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  filter(locality == "Nonmetropolitan")
gp_cod = cbind(gp_cod_data_Metro, gp_cod_data_nonMetro)

p = gp_cod %>%
plot_ly( x = ~year, y = ~mean_ped, name = 'Metropolitan', type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers') %>%
  add_trace( y = ~mean_ped1, name = 'Nonmetropolitan', mode = 'markers') %>% 
  layout(yaxis = list(title = 'mean percent excess death (Metropolitan/Nonmetropolitan)'))
p
})

```

This plot shows the gap of mean percent excess death for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan. Nonmetropolitan has a obviously larger mean percent excess death than metropolitan areas. In order to see if the difference is significant, we will run a regression analysis regarding mean excess death and locality.  



#### Regression Analysis
```{r wp2241 reg,  message=FALSE}
gp_locality_lm = lm(mean_ped ~locality , data = gp_cod_data)
summary(gp_locality_lm)
rl4 = broom::tidy(gp_locality_lm)
kable(rl4)
```

**interpretation on linear regression:**
The regression model is mean percent_excess_death = 33.89 - 2.05*Metropolitan + 8.046Nonmetropolitan. For people in metropolitan, the expected percent excess death has a decrease of 2.06. For people in non-metropolitan aream the expected percent excess death has an increase of 8.046. The p-values show these predictors are both significant. The adjusted R squared is 0.91, which indicates the regression model explains 91% of variation in mean percent excess death due to the variation in locality.  



### Mean Percent Excess Death vs. Causes of Death
**How should we help nonmetropolitan areas improve public health? **
```{r cl3664 data,  message=FALSE}
cod_datayr2 = read_csv("./data/NCHS_-_Potentially_Excess_Deaths_from_the_Five_Leading_Causes_of_Death.csv") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  filter(!(state == "United States")) %>%
  separate(., percent_potentially_excess_deaths, into = c("percent_excess_death"), sep = "%") %>%
  mutate(percent_excess_death = as.numeric(percent_excess_death), mortality = observed_deaths/population * 10000, mortality = as.numeric(mortality)) %>%
  select(year, cause_of_death, state, benchmark, locality, observed_deaths, population, expected_deaths, potentially_excess_deaths, percent_excess_death, mortality)
```

```{r cl3664 plot,  message=FALSE}
cod_datayr2 %>%
  filter(benchmark == "2010 Fixed")%>%
  group_by(cause_of_death,year, locality)%>%
  mutate(year_percent_death=mean(percent_excess_death))%>%
  distinct(year, cause_of_death, locality, .keep_all = TRUE)%>%
  ungroup(year, locality)%>%
ggplot(aes(x = year, y = year_percent_death, color = cause_of_death))+
  geom_point(size = 1)+
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  facet_grid(.~locality)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+
  scale_x_continuous( breaks=seq(2005,2015,1))+
  labs(title = "Average yearly excess death percentage for different locality")
```

**interpretation on linear regression:**
As can be seen in the plot, if we stratify by cause, we will find some increasing pattern in subgroups(unintentional injury) in certain period of time(2010-2015). In nonmetropolitan regions, unintentional injury and chronic lower respiratory disease have on average the highest excess death percentage in nonmetropolitan areas and needs more attention from public health experts.




```{r cl3664 lm,  message=FALSE}
cod_datayrlm = cod_datayr2 %>%
  filter(locality == "Nonmetropolitan",
         benchmark == "2010 Fixed")
lmpop = lm(data=cod_datayrlm, percent_excess_death~year+cause_of_death)
summary(lmpop)
rl5 = broom::tidy(lmpop)
kable(rl5)
```

From the linear model based on 2010 fixed benchmark, we can tell that controlling for cause of death, the  excess death percentage is expected to decrease by 0.37 each year. Overall, the excess death percentage shows a decreasing pattern with time. Besides, in the same year, compared with cancer, other 4 causes have significantly higher excess death percentage. Herein unintentional injury and chronic lower respiratory disease have on average the highest excess death percentage.



### Mean Percentage of Excess Death vs. Five Leading Cause of Death
**For each of the five cause of death, what is the mean percent of excess death? It is different across locality.**
As shown in the boxplots for all three regions, the rank of the five cause of death remain the same for different localities. For all five causes, the mean percent of death is lower for `Metropolitan` and higher for `Nonmetropolotan`.

```{r yz3306.1,  message=FALSE}
cod_data %>%
  select(state, locality, percent_excess_death, hhs_region, cause_of_death) %>%
  filter(locality != "All") %>% 
  mutate(hhs_region = as.factor(hhs_region)) %>% 
  group_by(cause_of_death, locality) %>% 
  summarise(mean_ped = mean(percent_excess_death)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = cause_of_death,  y = mean_ped, fill = cause_of_death)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_grid(~locality) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) 
```

For the above graph, if we seperate the effect of the gap between urban and rural area into different HHS region(Figure "above") as mentioned, the following chart gives detailed information.
```{r yz3306.3, message=FALSE}
cod_data %>%
  select(state, locality, percent_excess_death, hhs_region, cause_of_death) %>%
  filter(locality != "All") %>% 
  mutate(hhs_region = as.factor(hhs_region)) %>% 
  group_by(cause_of_death, locality,hhs_region) %>% 
  summarise(mean_ped = mean(percent_excess_death)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = hhs_region,  y = mean_ped, fill = hhs_region)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_grid(~cause_of_death) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 15)) +
    labs(
      y = "Mean %Excess Death",
      x = "HHS Regions",
      fill = "HHS Region"
    ) 
    
  
```

In order to take the effect of Localtiy into account, Flexdashboard with Shiny will be helpful. the link to the Shiny page is [Here - "Comparison of Difference in Mean %Excess Death of Five Leading Causes of Death in each HHS regions between Metropolitan and Nonmetropolitan Area"](https://github.com/Fionalav/final_project_shiny). 


Regress percent of excess death on cause of death, which is a categorical variable. with respect to cancer, the least of the five causes, all 4 have additional percent of death as evaluated by the estimates. The results give statisically significant estimates .
